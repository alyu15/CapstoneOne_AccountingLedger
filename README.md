## Interesting Piece of Code
```
for (FinancialGoal trackGoal : goalsList) {

            double remaining = trackGoal.getTargetAmount() - trackGoal.getCurrentAmount();
            String formattedDate = dateFormat.format(trackGoal.getTargetDate());

            System.out.printf("~ '%s' -- Current Amount: $%.2f -- Target Amount: $%.2f -- Remaining Amount: $%.2f -- Target Date: %s\n",
                    trackGoal.getReason(),
                    trackGoal.getCurrentAmount(),
                    trackGoal.getTargetAmount(),
                    remaining,
                    formattedDate);
        }
```
I chose this piece of code because a lot of people, including myself, don't have the greatest self-discipline 
when it comes to their spending habits. I find having the contribution amounts, target amounts, 
and remaining amounts especially helpful because it allows the user to teach  a little self-discipline 
because it is easily laid out right in front of them, allowing for easy readability. 

Including the reasoning behind the goal as well as the target date also further reinforces motivating 
oneself to achieving their financial goals.
